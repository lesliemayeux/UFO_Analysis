# UFO_Analysis
## Project Overview
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

### What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of one technical analysis deliverable and a written report. You will submit the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

## Analysis

## How to Perform a Search
This webpage provides a summary of UFO sightings along with the abiliy to search for certain sightings by type in either a date, city, state, country or shape.

### Search Options

Here is an example of how you search by state:

You can do this with each of the different fields.

## Summary

## Drawback
One of the drawbacks I noticed was that it does not options for each of the search options.
Here is what I think they could do to fix that:
- Provide a drop down of the available options for each of the search fields so you do not waste time type in random cities.
- Provide a better outline for format.
